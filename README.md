# AWS CodeGuru Security Scanner Action

Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer is a developer tool powered by machine learning that provides intelligent recommendations for improving code quality. The Security scanner leverages automated reasoning and AWSâ€™s years of security experience to improve your code security. It ensures that your code follows best practices for KMS, EC2 APIs and common Java crypto and TLS/SSL libraries. When the security detector discovers an issue, a recommendation for remediation is provided along with an explanation for why the code improvement is suggested, thereby enabling Security Engineers to focus on architectural and application-specific security best-practices. For more information, see [CodeGuru Security blog](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/reviewer-ug/how-codeguru-reviewer-works.html).
